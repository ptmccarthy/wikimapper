## A Chrome extension to map your Wikipedia navigation.

WikiMapper creates a historical tree of your Wikipedia browsing so that you can see just exactly how you spontaneously wasted 45 minutes and ended up reading about the history of Agriculture in Uzbekistan.

**NEW!** WikiMapper now supports the Chrome manifest v3 standard, hopefully ensuring many more years of functionality! Thank you to everyone who reached out to support modernizing this extension, it was no small task and your encouragement made it happen!

WikiMapper is available for free in the Chrome Web Store! [Click here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wikimapper/feiheebgoilmbkaddngcoocjbogfchlb?hl=en&gl=US)

### How It Works

WikiMapper runs in the background and only collects page data when browsing on the `wikipedia.org` and `wikimedia.org` domains.

WikiMapper primarily makes use of the `chrome.webNavigation` APIs to detect and correllate browsing activity. Data is stored locally in Chrome's' `localStorage`.

To open the WikiMapper application, click on the ![WikiMapper](https://github.com/ptmccarthy/wikimapper/blob/master/src/resources/wikimapper-16.png) icon in Chrome's toolbar.
